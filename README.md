# b: A tiny [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) client written in typescript

[bittorrent](https://bittorrent.org) is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol, used to distribute files over the Internet. Peer-to-peer means that clients do not need to connect to a central server to retrieve or distribute files. Instead, each client connects directly to other clients. This is the basis for the BitTorrent protocol.
